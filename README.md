# generator-readme-structure
> A Yeoman generator to create readme and wiki files based on pre-defined structure.
 
**readme**: will contain all the generic stuff  <br />
**wiki**:   will contain all what is internal and needs to be shared between the committers of a project.
 

## Prerequisities

* Node (https://nodejs.org)
* Yeoman :

```bash
npm install -g yo 
```

## Usage

1- install the generator globally
```bash
npm install -g generator-readme-structure
```
2- run the generator from your project root folder
```bash
yo readme-structure
```
## Verification
you can run this command to detect potential issues with the system that could prevent Yeoman from working correctly

```bash 
yo doctor
```
